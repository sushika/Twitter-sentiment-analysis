# 🐦 Twitter Sentiment Analysis  

## 📌 Overview  
This project focuses on analyzing the **sentiment of tweets** using **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques. By applying machine learning models, the goal is to **classify tweets as positive, negative, or neutral**, helping businesses, analysts, and researchers understand public opinion on various topics.

## 📂 Files in This Repository  
- **📜 Model.ipynb** – Jupyter Notebook containing **data preprocessing, feature extraction, model training, and evaluation**.  
- **📜 README.md** – Documentation providing an overview of the project.  

## 🛠️ Key Steps Taken  

### 1️⃣ Data Collection & Preprocessing  
- ✅ Collected tweets from **Twitter API or pre-existing datasets**.  
- ✅ Cleaned and tokenized text (removed stopwords, punctuation, and special characters).  
- ✅ Converted text into numerical representations using **TF-IDF, CountVectorizer, or Word Embeddings**.  

### 2️⃣ Model Selection & Training  
- ✅ Implemented **Machine Learning classifiers** like **Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Naïve Bayes** for sentiment analysis.  
- ✅ Fine-tuned models to improve accuracy and reduce bias.  
- ✅ Used **Sentiment Polarity Scoring (e.g., VADER, TextBlob)** for an alternative sentiment evaluation.  

### 3️⃣ Model Evaluation & Insights  
- 📌 **Achieved high accuracy in classifying tweets as Positive, Negative, or Neutral**.  
- 📌 **Common words in negative tweets include frustration-related terms**, while positive tweets feature appreciation words.  
- 📌 **Potential improvements include deep learning-based sentiment analysis using LSTMs or BERT**.  

### 💡 Applications & Impact  
- 📊 **Brand Monitoring** – Companies can analyze customer feedback on social media.  
- 🗳 **Political & Social Trends** – Sentiment analysis can track public opinion on policies or events.  
- 📈 **Market Analysis** – Businesses can assess consumer sentiment before launching products.
